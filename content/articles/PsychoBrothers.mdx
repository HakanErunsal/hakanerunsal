## Overview
Psycho Brothers is an incomplete hobby project designed as a multiplayer shooter game. The game includes an online lobby and join system which
is designed as a plugin for me to use in any project i want in the future (written in c++), 
multiplayer support via Steam and Google Play Games (not fully tested), accommodates up to four players who can battle each other and AI-controlled monsters. Although the 
game is unfinished, it already features a weapon system, allowing players to switch between different weapons, and a basic health system to shoot each other.

## Weapon System

The game includes a basic weapon system that allows players to switch between different weapons. Each weapon has unique attributes, providing diverse gameplay experiences. The modularity of the base classes, adding a new type of weapon with even a new type of projectile is very smooth and takes only 5-10 minutes.

## Health System

A simple health system is implemented, tracking player health and handling damage from both players and monster attacks. This system is essential for the core gameplay loop of battling and survival.

## Monster AI Enemies

In addition to player-vs-player combat which is only for test purposes, Psycho Brothers features AI-controlled monsters that add an extra layer of challenge. The main idea of the game is
 killing weird monsters together as 4-brothers. Enemies are not fully implemented so i cannot demonstrate.

## Conclusion
Psycho Brothers is a work-in-progress project that already showcases essential multiplayer shooter features. 
While incomplete, it offers a solid foundation for further development and potential future release. 
The project highlights the core mechanics and multiplayer capabilities, 
hinting at the potential for a full-fledged game with additional time and resources. **Inspired from 2-brothers on Rick and Morty multidimensional cable.**
