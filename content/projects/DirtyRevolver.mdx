### Overview

Dirty Revolver is a third-person western cowboy shooter game with immersive gameplay and stunning graphics. This project was a collaboration with another company where I worked as the sole developer, supported by a team of talented artists. 

### Development Journey

I made this game when i was working at DreamboxTV. Making Dirty Revolver was a unique adventure. As the only developer on the project, I was responsible for everything from coding and optimization to deploying, testing, debugging, and bug fixing. I worked with very talented artists who brought the Wild West to life, and it was my job to ensure the game ran smoothly and was engaging for players.

### Key Techniques and Learnings

- **Managing Art Team:** Majority of my experience of managing a team of artists and assets comes from this project.
- **Comprehensive Development:** I made the skeleton and character rigging. As well as the animation setup in Animation Blueprints. Took on all aspects of development, including coding, optimization, testing, and deployment.
- **Dynamic Weather Conditions:** Developed a system to handle different weather conditions such as rain, snow, sunny, and stormy weather to enhance the gameplay experience. On mobile development with this low budgets, you have to recycle a lot of things without letting player notice.
- **Optimization for Mobile:** Ensured the game performed well on a wide range of mobile devices through extensive optimization and testing.
